Case Scenario
As the Linux Administrator for a fast-growing company, you have been tasked with creating, modifying, and removing user accounts from the Linux server
. The company has just hired 9 new employees to fill 3 newly designed departments. The departments that have been created are Engineering, Sales and IS. 
The server must be set up with the appropriate files, folders, users, groups and permissions to ensure a successful launch of the newly designed departments.
Objectives
* Create a directory at the root (/) of the file system for each department. This name should reflect the department name that will use the directory.
cd /
sudo mkdir IS Sales Engineering


* Create a group for each department. This name should reflect the department name that the group will be assigned.
sudo groupadd IS 
sudo groupadd Sales
sudo groupadd Engineering

* Create an administrative user for each of the departments.



* The user will have a Bash login shell.
* The user will belong to the respective group for each department. This will need to be the user’s primary group.

sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -g IS Is-admin
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -g Sales Sales-admin
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -g Engineering Engr-admin

* Create two additional users for each department.



* The users will have a Bash login shell.
* The users will belong to their respective group for each department. This will need to be the user’s primary group.
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -g IS Is-user1
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -g IS Is-user2
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -g Sales Sales-user1
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -g Sales Sales-user2
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -g Engineering Engr-user1
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -g Engineering Engr-user2

* For security reasons, the following modifications will need to be made to each of the departments' respective directories:


* Ensure that the owner of each of the directories is the department administrator and the group ownership is the group for each department.
* The department administrator will have full access to their respective department directories.
* Ensure that only the owner of a file in the department’s directory can delete the file. The user will also have ownership of their respective department folders.
* Normal users in each department will have full access (Read, Write and Execute) to their respective department folders.
The department folders will ONLY be accessible by users/administrators in each of the respective departments. Ensure that no one else will have permissions to the folders.
sudo chown IS Is-admin
sudo chown Sales Sales-admin
sudo chown Engineering Engr-admin
chgrp IS IS
chgrp Sales Sales
chrgrp Engineering Engineering
sudo chmod 1770 /IS
sudo chmod 1770 /Sales
sudo chmod 1770 /Engineering
* Create a document in each of the department directories.


* The ownerships on this file will be the same as the directory it is located in.
* The document should contain only one line of text that states, “This file contains confidential information for the department.”
* This file can be read by any user in the department, but can only be modified by the department administrator. No one else has permissions to this file.
sudo nano /IS/Confidential
sudo nano /Sales/Confidential
sudo nano /Engineering/Confidential
sudo chmod 740 /IS/Confidential
sudo chmod 740 /Sales/Confidential
sudo chmod 740 /Engineering/Confidential


Deliverables
* Use the appropriate command to verify each user and group has been created
sudo tail -5 /etc/passwd
sudo tail -5 /etc/group

* Use the appropriate command to verify each user’s group assignment.
sudo ls -l /

* Use the appropriate command to verify the directory creation and the permission settings.
sudo ls -ld /IS
sudo ls -ld /Sales
sudo ls -ld /Engineering
* Use the appropriate command to verify the files are created in their respective directories.
sudo ls -l /IS/Confidential
sudo ls -l /Sales/Confidential
sudo ls -l /Engineering/Confidential
